All simulations were run on a core i9-7920X running Ubuntu 18.04.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To generate white Gaussian noise (WGN),
the first methods examined were functions available in the Intel Math
Kernel Library (MKL). Figure one shows the expected probability
density function (PDF) and that obtained by counting number of
samples in each 0.01 sigma “bucket” for a large number of
samples. This was done using the VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_ICDF
function.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The horizontal black line corresponds
to just 1 sample in a give 0.01 sigma “bucket” for this number of
trials. There is a factor of 2 involved because an absolute value is
taken on the generated samples due to symmetry. Obviously, this
method shows strong quantization effects around sigma=5, and it will
never generate a value greater than 5.3 sigma.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, the MKL function
VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_BOXMULLER2 was used, with results shown in
the figure below:<img src="normal.box.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="872" height="697" border="0"/>

<br clear="left"/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Here, we now see a limit of about 6.7
sigma, with some undulations around the true PDF for sigma greater
than 6.3 sigma. The number of samples per second as well as the
quality is better than the ICDF function, so it is unclear why the
ICDF function would ever be the preferred option. Again, the black
line shows that enough samples were generated to have plenty (about
20 or more) samples in each 0.01 sigma bucket.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, a custom AVX-based normal
distribution was written to try to get faster sample generation and a
higher quality distribution. The PRNG is used is an AVX-aware version
of sfc64. The sfc64 algorithm is described in
<a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/RNG_engines.txt">http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/RNG_engines.txt</a>.
There is also an option to use an AVX-aware version of the
xoshiro256++ PRNG. This algorithm is described in
<a href="https://prng.di.unimi.it/">https://prng.di.unimi.it/</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If any of the 8 32-bit random integer
values in a given 256-bit AVX word are less than 8, then an
additional AVX word of PRNG values are generated, allowing for 8
64-bit random integers for this case. This extends the maximum sigma
to about 9.3 while only incurring the additional computation very
rarely. Results are shown below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="normal.custom.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="872" height="698">

<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Here, we are definitely hitting the
point where some “buckets” only have 1 sample in them, which
occurs whenever the green line touches the black line. Given enough
time, one could increase the number of trials beyond 1.6e14 if
desired. There is also a bit of undulation near 6.3 sigma. This is
where the original 32-bit PRNG is used, before transitioning to
64-bit. One could push this back a bit to remove this if desired.
Overall, the 14.7 Gsamp/sec is almost 3x faster than the 5.3
Gsamp/sec observed for the MKL function.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The end result is fast generation of
WGN samples with a very high maximum sigma.</p>
