/*
Benchmark code as suggested in "How to Benchmark Code Execution Times on 
IntelÂ® IA - 32 and IA - 64 Instruction Set Architectures"

Handles serialization and out-of-order execution

arguments are 32-bit unsigned ints (uint32)

For cleaner usage, the START and STOP macros assume that following are declared:
unsigned rdtsc_start_high, rdtsc_start_low, rdtsc_stop_high,rdtsc_top_low
uint64_t rdtsc_count[N] , with with N chosen to provide sufficient storage
unsigned rdtsc_idx

Then, usage becomes:
RDTSC_START
..do stuff..
RDTSC_STOP

print rdtsc_count[i] to see TSC counts elapsed

RDTSC_RAW only does a RDTSC, without queue flushes.  Can be used
for checkpointing with minimal overhead
